    This view allows the user to jump to any date of the year. It's supposed to only allow them to
    jump to days that have passed, but that hasn't been implemented yet, so the numbers are only
    grayed out yet still clickable.

    It's entirely Javascript generated since making more than 400 elements would be a pain.

    During it's generation, the Javascript also checks the transactions for each day and
    colors the day's background that days dominant category color. That is the category
    that was used the most that day, so If you have 5 'grocery', 3 'hygiene' and 1 'car parts',
    the day will be colored whatever color the 'grocery' category has stored.
