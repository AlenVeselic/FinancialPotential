<!--
    Main index window for my finance logging web app, on first visiting it opens up a simple view
    for your current day where you can start adding transactions or traversing day by day or entering
    calendar view by clicking on the date display on the header.

    TODO: Make button look interactable, right now they are stripped of all style, leaving them to look like
    mere text you can click on.

<!--
    Here I tested out google fonts, font importing by link using a link tag

<!-- 
    The body consists of a head and a middle area.
    The head area contains the date and the separate arrows used go forward or backward by a day.
    If you are on present day you the button to go forward is disabled, since this app is for finance
    logging and not future transaction planning at the moment.

    The middle area consists of the content and it's empty side areas. Within the content area,
    the user can view, add or remove their transactions.
    The transaction font color for each transaction is determined by the category's color which the user chooses on category creation.

    Always at the bottom of the content is where small stats are displayed. At this point that's the sum of
    money spent on the given day.

    If the viewport reaches a width lesser than 1000px, the site's layout turns mobile. Which, at this point, only
    makes the nav arrows cover the sides of the middle, making them easier to click and spot on a smaller screen.
